# JAVA-QUIZ-TASK-2
Making a user friendly quiz in java using swing.
Creating a comprehensive quiz platform in Java with all the requested features is a substantial project. Here's a high-level overview of how to implement such a platform, including user registration, login, multiple quiz categories, various question formats, a scoring system, timer, instant feedback, and an admin panel for managing quizzes. The solution will involve multiple components, including the GUI, database interactions, and business logic.

We'll use the following tools and frameworks:

Swing for the GUI.
JDBC for database interaction.
MySQL as the database.
Maven for dependency management and project setup.
Project Structure
Model: Classes representing the data (User, Quiz, Question, etc.).
View: GUI components.
Controller: Handles the logic and user interactions.
Database: Handles data persistence.
